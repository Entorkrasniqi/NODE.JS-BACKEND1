## Project Overview
This project is a media sharing application built with Node.js and Express. It implements user authentication and authorization, allowing users to manage their media items securely. The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Authentication
- **Login Endpoint**: Implemented a `POST /api/auth/login` endpoint that allows users to log in using their email and password.
- **JWT Authentication**: Utilized JSON Web Tokens to authenticate users. Upon successful login, a token is generated and returned to the user.

### 2. User Authorization
- **Protected Routes**: Implemented authorization for specific routes to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions:
  - **PUT /api/media/:id**: Only the owner of the media item can update it.
  - **DELETE /api/media/:id**: Only the owner of the media item can delete it.
  - **PUT /api/users/**: Users can only update their own user information.

### 3. Middleware Implementation
- **Authentication Middleware**: Created middleware to verify JWT tokens and authenticate users.
- **Authorization Middleware**: Developed middleware to check if users are authorized to access or modify specific resources (media items and user information).

### 4. Project Structure
- **Routes**: Organized routes into separate files for authentication, media, and user management.
- **Middleware**: Created a dedicated directory for middleware functions to handle authentication and authorization logic.
- **Models**: Used models to interact with the database for user and media data.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server.
- **Express**: Web framework for building the RESTful API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user and media data (assumed based on context).
- **JWT**: For secure user authentication.
- **Bcrypt.js**: For hashing passwords.

## Usage
- **Register a User**: Use the `POST /api/auth/register` endpoint to create a new user.
- **Login**: Use the `POST /api/auth/login` endpoint to log in and receive a JWT token.
- **Manage Media**: Use the media endpoints to create, update, delete, and retrieve media items, ensuring you include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header for protected routes.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the implementation of user authentication and authorization in a Node.js application, following best practices for security and code organization. The modular structure allows for easy maintenance and scalability.
